# Spin-Hardware
Control system PCB files for The Greatest Danger and The Greatest Challenge. This Repo includes KiCAD projects for two boards, "Spin-Sonic" and "Spin-Eggman". "Spin-Sonic" is the main control board with RF, sensing, and the main MCU. "Spin-Eggman" is a power distribution board used to compactly mount the main switch, bulk capacitors, and battery connectors.

> ⚠️ WARNING
> This design is made public to be a reference for the curious, I don't reccomend anyone try to reproduce these boards. Learn more at the bottom of this page.
